## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently studying Computer Science Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve had the chance to explore and gain experience in diverse areas such as application development, software testing, and database administration. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked with a wide range of technologies, including multiple programming languages, frameworks, and database systems. Iâ€™m eager to apply the skills and knowledge Iâ€™ve built so far, and I remain open to discovering new areas and tackling the various challenges the professional world presents.
